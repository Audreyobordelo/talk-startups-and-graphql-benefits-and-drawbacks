# A talk on why GraphQL can be a good choice for Startups

This talk is about the pertinence of GraphQL in a startup.

When launching a startup, a lot of critical choices must be made. In this postmortem, we will discuss how GraphQL allowed https://teamstarter.co to thrive.

In this talk we expect you to already know the basics of GraphQL. If you do not know them, I added some good references bellow to consult before going through the slides.

The slides are available [online](https://vincentdesmares.github.io/talk-startups-and-graphql-benefits-and-drawbacks/).
